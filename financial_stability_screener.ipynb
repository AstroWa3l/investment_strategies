    "## Why Financial Stability Stocks Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "As an investor, you want to see your investments weather any financial storm that comes their way. In order for you to achieve a sense of financial stability and security in your investment portfolio, looking into these metrics might be a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Debt to Equity Ratio**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debt-to-Equity Ratio (D/E): A lower D/E ratio suggests a company is not overly reliant on debt, which is crucial during economic downturns.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Current Ratio**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Current Ratio: A higher current ratio indicates a company can pay off its short-term liabilities, which is a sign of financial stability. Current Ratio: Measures a company's ability to cover short-term obligations. A ratio above 1 indicates good short-term financial health.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Return on Assets**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return on Assets (ROA): A higher ROA indicates that a company is using its assets efficiently to generate profits.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Return on Equity**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Return on Equity (ROE): A higher ROE indicates that a company is generating more profit with less equity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Interest Coverage Ratio**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interest Coverage Ratio: A higher ratio indicates a company is more capable of paying off its interest expenses."

    "## Let's Look At Some Stocks to Analyze\n",
    "\n",
    "We will look at the FAANG stocks namely Meta, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, NVIDIA, and Google. These are some of the most popular tech stocks in the market today. We will analyze these stocks based on the financial stability metrics mentioned above. We could also look at all the stocks in for say in a major index like the S&P 500 and then analyze the stocks based on the same metrics but this requires a lot of data, time, and money to pay for alpha vantage API calls."
