Collection of quantitative analysis notebooks for investing in various asset classes

## What is in this repository?

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that I have written to analyze various investment strategies, various screening methods, and visualizations. The notebooks are not organized currently, but I will be organizing them in the future. We will use a host of available financial python libraries such as `yfinance`, `alpaca`, and `alpha_vantage` to get the data that we need then use libraries like `backtrader` to backtest our strategies.

Some of the topics that I have covered in this repository are:

#### **Stock Screening**: 

I have written a few notebooks that screen stocks based on various criteria such as:

1. Financial Stability: We look into metrics such as current ratio, quick ratio, debt to equity ratio, etc.
2. Dividend Metrics: We look into metrics such as dividend yield, dividend payout ratio, etc.
3. Growth Metrics: We look into metrics such as revenue growth, earnings growth, etc.
4. Valuation Metrics: We look into metrics such as PE ratio, PEG ratio, Free Cash Flow, etc.
5. Stability During Recession: We look into metrics such as beta, etc.
6. Technical Indicators: We look into metrics such as RSI, MACD, MA, etc.

After we are done with screening, we will have a list of stocks that we can further analyze. and try to estimate optimal price points to buy and sell.
